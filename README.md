#### About Machine Learning Models Used:
Three baseline models were chosen to be used among with the some more complex models. Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) were selected
since they have an extensive use in the topic of IDS, are easy to implement and support multi-class classification. Also a Bagging and a Boosting classifier were utilised. 

#### About Resampling Techniques:
Network traffic datasets used for IDS are usually imbalanced. Imbalanced data usually lead to a biased model towards the majority class. 
From our perspective to tackle this problem, resampling techniques such as SMOTE and Tomekâ€™s link  were utilised in order to alleviate data imbalances between classes.
